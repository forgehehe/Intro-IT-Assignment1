            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr><br><br>
            <p>Hey! My name is Benjamin Bilotta and am currently 19 years old living in Melbourne, Victoria. I have 2 brothers, with my older brother (22) being a qualified Mechanic for BMW and my younger brother (18) taking a gap year of after he finished year 12. I also have a half-sister on my dads’ side who is married with kids… which made me an uncle at only 10 years old!</p>
            <p>I have quite a big family which is to be expected as my nationality is Uruguayan and Italian. While I haven’t been fortunate enough to visit Italy, I did get the chance to go to Uruguay and experience life in with my, what felt like, millions of cousins in the beautiful country of Uruguay in South America.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I have 3 pets. I've got a small cat named Sahara and 2 dogs. My first dog is a Great Dane mix called Jack. We rescued Jack from the RSPCA around 8 years ago. My second dog is a German Shepard by the name of Cesar, and he is only 2 years old.</p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>My education journey has been quite straight forward, as I completed VCE in 2019 with an ATAR of 86.25. I decided that I wanted to go straight into university after graduating and given my first choice at RMIT for Engineering and Computer Science. However about 1 year and a half into my program I wasn't too happy with what I was studying and decided to change to what I am currently studying. That being a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
            <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
            <p>When it comes to my hobbies and interest, I would say it’s basic. I enjoy playing video games… like a lot. I have over 3k hours in Counterstrike: Global Offensive across 3 accounts. I play majority of my games on my PC. I also really enjoy building computers as I’ve built around 10 computers for friends and family. My current specs are:</p>
            <table>

                    <tr>
                        <td>CPU</td>
                        <td>Ryzen 5 3600x</td>
                        <td rowspan="4"><img width="250px" src="images/computer.jpg" alt="Photo of My Computer"></td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>GPU</td>
                        <td>GIGABYTE GEFORCE RTX 3070</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>ASUS x570</td>

                        <td>16BG HyperX Fury 3200MHZ</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Other hobbies of mine that aren’t related to tech are going out to my local skatepark and well skateboarding. Some people would refer to me as a young Tony Hawk. As well as this I’m an active music listener and am a big fan of artist like Logic, Hopsin, J.Cole and Childish Gambino. I also like to watch anime and read manga, with my favourites being Parasyte, Naruto, and Jujutsu Kaisen.</p>
            <h2>IT interest</h2>
            <p>For as long as I can remember I was into IT. I started playing games at a young age on Sega Genesis and progressed through the consoles. As well as this in year 10 I took VET multimedia where I learnt to build websites. This for me is where I found my real passion. I accelerated in this class and loved the creativity I could expresses. As well as this I was completely new to the website building space and was and continue to learn so much. As well as this I took computing during my time in VCE and enjoyed building databases and learning about how they are used. All these put together were the driving factors into me pursuing further studies in the technology field.</p>
            <h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
            <p>There are few reasons why I chose to study at RMIT. For one while in my final year of study we had an excursion to different unis and one of them was RMIT. We had a tour around the city campus and I kind of knew I wanted to study here. I enjoy how easy it is to commute to for me, the location of the city campus and on top of this I have a friend who just finished his civil engineering course, and he couldn't recommend it more. I also like the option to study abroad if I wanted to do so, although I probably won’t with covid happening. Finally, RMIT diverse community and welcome aura really helped to make me feel welcomed and at home when I started studying there last year.</p>
            <p>Ultimately what I want to get out of my degree is a job. As well learning about the different corners of the IT world and seeing how they all interact with my everyday life. I would also like to pinpoint my study and focus more on the Front-End development as the end goal is to be working in that section. In terms of skills, I wish to learn, I would love to become proficient with databases, whether that be with <b>SQL</b> or another database language. I also want to become efficient with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> and learn some <b>JavaScript</b>. Finally, I just want to enjoy my time whilst still at university, by building my connections and learning about things I find interesting.</p>

            <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
            <hr><br><br>
            <p>For me there are many factors that make an ideal job… well ideal. For instance, I find it important to have the option to express myself creatively and provide my own feedback or ideas. As well as this having the option to work abroad or travel would be great as I’ve always wanted to travel the world. Furthermore, money is always a factor and ideally, I’d love to be making more than $80,000. Finally, a job in the front-end side is what I am aiming for as I love HTML, CSS and really want to learn JS. Furthermore, I have knowledge in databases.</p>

            <h2>Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
            <span id="imgRight">
                <p>For this personality test my result determined that I was a <b>Mediator (INFP-T)</b>. While I necessarily don't align with all the aspects of this category, there are certain features which stand out and match me. 
                <br>For instance, mediators are <b>open-minded</b>, <b>creative</b>, and <b>passionate</b>. For me I like to believe I am an open minded individual, and at times I can be quite passionate however only about things I have a great interest for.
                <br>The weakness of a mediator which I relate to the most are them being <b>unfocused</b> as I find myself procrastinating a lot about things that need to be done. I am also quite critical of myself and my work, always thinking I could have done better with the time given.</p>

            <h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
            <p>For the leanring style test I used the one on <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?" target="_blank">educationplanner.org</a>.
            <br>My results after taking this test was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Auditory: 30%</li>
                <li>Visual: 15%</li>
                <li>Tactile: 55%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After a bit of reading I was able to find that this pretty much sums up into me being a hands on learner, and needing some physical enternainment involved to learn best. Personally I don't think that aligns to much with me, however it does say that I require frequent breaks. During face to face learning this wasn't the case however at home trying to study or learn I find myself going for small walk abouts around the house to refresh my mind quite often.</p>
            <h2>The Big Five Personality Test</h2>
            <span id="imgLeft">
                <p>For this test I was given the personality type of OCEAN. OCEAN stands for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism</p>
                <img src="images/bigFiveResults.png" alt="">
            </span>
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>Overall, from these results I believe it is clear to say that I can be quite creative and open minded with what I do. However, I can also become unfocused and procrastinate on things that I am not to passionate or excited about.</p>
            <p>In terms of a group environment this would mean that if my selected task was something I enjoyed I would have no issue completing the task on time. However, if I was given a role or task which meant I was to complete something that wasn’t necessarily interesting to me, I would take my time to finish it and put the task off until I find some passion in the task. I also would be quite open to receiving feedback and getting a different insight on ways a task could be done, and in return I’m always willing to provide some valuable information and feedback to my teammates.
            <br>When forming a team I would take into account the passions of everyone in the team and try to find something that we all find interesting, which in turn would motivate me to work my hardest. I also think having a strong leader keep track of myself and other team members with good time management skills will ensure that everything could be completed in an orderly matter.</p>
            <p>Overall, I’ve worked in many teams before and always bring my A game to the table and do my best to ensure that I and my teammates can finish the tasks with the best possible outcome.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For this project the idea which I would like to pursue is to create a chatbot by the name of THALIA. This bot would take on a persona of a fictional character in a fictional. The premise of this character and this world would be based on an album by Logic called The Incredible True Story.</p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>My motivation to pursue this project idea is because for one I am a big fan of Logic and this album and haven’t found a chat bot of this nature. The reason why I think a product like this should exist however is it would create a more immersive experience when paired with the album.</p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Chatbot THALIA is based on a fictional AI on the ship the Aquarius III. Talking to THALIA would provide the user with some insight into the world, understanding the fictional demise of Earth. As well as this THALIA would provide pop-culture references and answer various questions the user might have, as seen in the skits on the album. This Wikipedia article goes over the base story line of what has happened, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_True_Story 
            <br>The program would open up with a small animation of the THALIA AI, and introduce itself to the user as it does in the album. The user would then be able to type to THALIA and it would provide responses based on what the user has said. For some responses THALIA would play an audio file of her speaking. 
            <br>If the user asks some questions which lead THALIA to question it existence or purpose having the ability to turn it rogue and start creating some coded messages would also be a feature that would be included.</p>
            <h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
            <p>The obvious requirements to make this project would be to have a computer to communicate with the team, write up the script and possible outcomes and obviously code the project. As well as this having a good Mic would be essential as having some voice lines recorded would provide an element of realism to the program.
            <br>In terms of software Visual Studio Code is the main software I would use to code this project on. As well as this audacity would be used to edit the recorded lines to give it some robotic effects and distort some lines. In terms of the coding language that would be used I will use Python.</p>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>The skills that are required to turn this into reality would be some coding skills with the language Python. Having some strong Python knowledge would be essential as well as reading up on how Chatbots work with the Python language. Some other skills that are required would be some audio editing skills, animation skills.
            <br>This project is quite feasible with the only real struggle being learning how to create the actual chatbot with Python.</p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>If this project is successful the anticipated outcome would be a program which is able to provide correct responses to user questions or input and successfully tell the story of the fictional world that has been built. It would also have a clean interface which is engaging to the eye and easy to use by the user.</p>
