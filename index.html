                <hr><br><br>
                <p>Hey! My name is Benjamin Bilotta and am currently 19 years old living in Melbourne, Victoria. I have 2 brothers, with my older brother (22) being a qualified Mechanic for BMW and my younger brother (18) taking a gap year of after he finished year 12. I also have a half-sister on my dads’ side who is married with kids… which made me an uncle at only 10 years old!</p>
                <p>I have quite a big family which is to be expected as my nationality is Uruguayan and Italian. While I haven’t been fortunate enough to visit Italy, I did get the chance to go to Uruguay and experience life in with my, what felt like, millions of cousins in the beautiful country of Uruguay in South America.</p>
                <p>On top of all this I have 3 pets. I've got a small cat named Sahara and 2 dogs. My first dog is a great dane mix called Jack. We rescued Jack from the RSPCA around 8 years ago. My second dog is a German Shepard by the name of Cesar and he is only 2 year.</p>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>My education journey has been quite straight forward, as I completed VCE in 2019 with an ATAR of 86.25. I decided that I wanted to go straight into uni after graduating and given my first choice at RMIT for Engineering and Computer Science. However about 1 year and a half into my program I wasn't to happy with what I was studying and decided to change to what I am currently studying. That being a bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
                <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
                <p>When it comes to my hobbies and interest, I would say its pretty basic. I enjoy playing video games… like a lot. I have over 3k hours in Counterstrike: Global Offensive across 3 accounts. I play majority of my games on my PC. I also really enjoy building computers as I’ve built around 10 computers for friends and family. My current specs are:</p>

                            <td>16BG HyperX Fury 3200MHZ</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>Other hobbies of mine that aren’t related to tech are going out to my local skatepark and well skateboarding. Some people would refer to me as a young Tony Hawk. As well as this I’m an active music listener and am a big fan of artist like Logic, Hopsin, J.Cole and Childish Gambino.</p>
