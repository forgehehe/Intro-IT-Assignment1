                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <hr><br><br>
                <p>Hey! My name is Benjamin Bilotta and am currently 19 years old living in Melbourne, Victoria. I have 2 brothers, with my older brother (22) being a qualified Mechanic for BMW and my younger brother (18) taking a gap year of after he finished year 12. I also have a half-sister on my dads’ side who is married with kids… which made me an uncle at only 10 years old!
                <br>I have quite a big family which is to be expected as my nationality is Uruguayan and Italian. While I haven’t been fortunate enough to visit Italy, I did get the chance to go to Uruguay and experience life in with my, what felt like, millions of cousins in the beautiful country of Uruguay in South America.</p>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>My education journey has been quite straight forward, as I completed VCE in 2019 with an ATAR of 86.25. I decided that I wanted to go straight into uni after graduating and given my first choice at RMIT for Engineering and Computer Science. However about 1 year and a half into my program I wasn't to happy with what I was studying and decided to change to what I am currently studying. That being a bachelor of Information Technology.</p>

                <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
                <p>My ideal job would consist of me sitting around doing nothing all day and getting paid alot. But unfortunetly a job like this doesn't exist. Just like every "young" person my age I find it hard to visualise or even fathem where I would be in 10 years time or even 5 years time for that matter. All I really know is that I enjoy building websites and would love to get paid for it!</p>
                <h3>Needs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>For one my ideal job involves money alot of money like fat racks and fat bags</li>
                    <li>Secondly I would love for the possibility to work from home or abroad.</li>
                </ol>
